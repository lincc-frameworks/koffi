# koffi
Known Objects From Fits Indices

A package that should hopefully be helpful to people working with shift-and-stack algorithms and other solar system science use cases. Given an input of possible solar system objects (PotentialSources) relating either to an x and y coordinate of a FITS image or an RA and Dec coordinate with a timestamp, we provide an easy API for converting x and y coordinates into RA and Dec and querying the most well known solar system dynamics api services. Uses the IMCCE's SkyBoT VO tool (Berthier et. al. 2006) and JPLâ€™s SSD (Solar System Dynamics) [API service](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/).

This package is based off of code developed by Jeremy Kubica for the [KBMOD](https://github.com/dirac-institute/kbmod) package.

## Setup
Package will be pip installable soon. Until then,
In python virtual environment of your choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/koffi.git
cd koffi
pip install .
python setup.py build
```

## Usage
At the most basic level, koffi can be used to find all the known objects based on FITS image metadata.
```python
import koffi

filename = 'path/to/image/data.fits'
image = koffi.ImageMetadata(filename)

# SkyBoT - get all possible objects in given image.
skybot_objects = koffi.skybot_search_frame(image)

# JPL Horizons = get all possible objects in given image.
jpl_objects = koffi.jpl.search_frame(image)
```

We can also use koffi to check against a list of provided sources; the search functions will return a list of matches.
```python
# a possible observation in ra dec + the observation time in mjd.
position = [200.501562, -14.166247]
time = image.get_epoch().mjd

# the PotentialSource class is our interface for checking possible discoveries against known objects.
# position at time can be access by ps[time]
ps = koffi.PotentialSource()
ps.build_from_times_and_known_positions([position], [time])

# return a list of possible matches, attached to the index of a potential source.
skybot_observations = koffi.skybot_query_known_objects([ps], image, tolerance = 0.25)

jpl_observations = koffi.jpl_query_known_objects([ps], image, tolerance = 0.25)
```

At the highest level, we can pass in a stack of images and potential sources and count the number of times they potentially appear in each image!
We do this by making use of the ImageMetadataStack class.
```python
filenames = [
	'/path/to/data/434593.fits', 
	'/path/to/data/434601.fits', 
	'/path/to/data/435478.fits', 
	'/path/to/data/435486.fits', 
	'/path/to/data/435494.fits'
]
# ImageMetadataStack will build the stack for you, just provide it with
# a list of filenames!
images = koffi.ImageMetadataStack(filenames)

# now let's make 2 PotentialSource objects, 2 different ways.
# we can build for a list of ra dec pairs...
positions1 = [
	[200.501433, -14.166194],
	[200.502433, -14.166194],
	[200.503433, -14.166194],
	[200.504433, -14.166194],
	[200.505433, -14.166194]
]
# or from a list of x and y coordinates in the image(s)!
positions2 = [
  [97, 200],
  [101, 204],
  [105, 208],
  [109, 212],
  [113, 216]
]

ps1 = koffi.PotentialSource()
ps2 = koffi.PotentialSource()

# it's highly recommended that you associated your potential source positions with times in mjd given
# from the ImageMetadataStack.get_mjds() method!
mjds = images.get_mjds()

ps1.build_from_times_and_known_positions(positions1, mjds)
ps2.build_from_images_and_xy_positions(positions2, mjds)
sources = [ps1, ps2]

# stack search functions will return a count of each object that it was able to be associated with a potential source.
# key for the dict is the index of potential sources.
possible_detections_skybot = koffi.skybot_query_known_objects_stack(sources, images)
possible_detections_jpl = koffi.jpl_query_known_objects_stack(sources, images)
```
